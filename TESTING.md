# Testing

## Manual Testing via localhost:8443

The testing is manual, and functional. I may expose another public reference implementation again soon.

I.e., does the service properly validate the certificate in contrast to the defined validation policy?

I'm using the following to execute and test, but you mileage may vary depending on how you deploy this implementation.

- Execute

`./local_execute.sh`

- Test (Via another terminal)

`./current_tests.sh`
